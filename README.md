# Speedtype

This is a simple speedtyping application. It has two different writing modes which are random full text writing and random words typing. With full text typing the user has to type in the given text until the end but with random words the user has to type as much as possible in 30 seconds.

The user also has the chance to add texts and also choose certain texts that he/she would like to do the test on. 

After the test the user can also save his/her score which will be displayed in the leaderboards.

This speedtype project was made in Java using JavaFX.
